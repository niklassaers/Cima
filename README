The purpose of this project is to create a Neo4J backed store for your iOS app's data.
I'd like to later on build a very, very similar fork for a Riak backed store and a MongoDB backed store

I've called it Cima, after the italian composer Giovanni Paolo Cima (c. 1570 â€“ 1622).

Inspirations on the iOS side (probably with a lot of up-coming copy/paste? ;-) ) are Datakit, RestKit and Magical Record

The Scala/Neo4J/Play part is built on (and probably butchered, sorry about that) the excelent work of Andy Petrella

NB, my main motivation for doing this is that I'm learning Scala. And I think DataKit is really cool, I think Neo4J is really cool, and I love working with Core Data.
NB, this is my first ever Scala project, so don't hold back on the pull requests or suggestions
NB, this is my easter holiday project. After easter, I'll have to look at the results and decide what to do with it from there
